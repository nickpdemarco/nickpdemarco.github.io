text: The plan was to augment a performance on a single cymbal with a live manipulation of prerecorded cymbal samples. Reflective tape on my mallets would be captured on camera (projected behind us), and "sweeping" motions would trigger the samples through a MaxMSP patch. My partners, Grant and Ben, would manipulate the samples with motion controlled (via Nintendo Wii Remotes) high pass filters, granular synthesis, and other effects. We'd create a rich blend of live sounds with unnatural digital textures. <blockquote> <p>I have always admired your professionalism during that performance — that you made the most of it, and didn’t let the tech issues get in your way. That shows a lot of poise. </p> <footer> Butch Rovan, Professor of the course and Faculty Director of the Brown Arts Initiative </footer> </blockquote> Unfortunately, due to a difference in lighting conditions between sound check and the performance, the sensitivity on the motion tracker was set too high. If you watch the performance, you'll see me get a bit flustered at first, as I considered what my options were. Perhaps taking inspiration from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_kloG2Z7tU"> Rowan Atkinson</a>, I attempted to use the malfunction to my advantage. I was trying, in real time, to figure out some deterministic way to trigger the samples. I let that exploration become a part of the performance, adding exaggerated expressions of confusion and frustration to create a wordless story arc.
