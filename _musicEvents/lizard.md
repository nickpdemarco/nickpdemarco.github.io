text: The Lizard House EP was written in the basement of a Victorian-era Providence home, outfitted with soundproofing equipment and more string lights than one would consider "tactful." Fronted by Joey Bacon, Superintendent was an indie rock band, characterized by intimate lyrics and a heavier rhythm section. It was the project that was the focus of my last two years at Brown, as a performer and as an audio engineer. This EP lived in post-production limbo for the better part of 2016, as two of the three of us had graduated and moved out of Providence. I mixed and mastered the EP in my free time, making liberal use of the wonderful recording studios on Brown's campus. 
roles: [drum, record, mix, master]
