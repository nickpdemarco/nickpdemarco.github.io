text: When I first asked my former bandmates if I could publish our album from high school, one jokingly pleaded, "maybe don't put up the ska song." With the wisdom afforded by hindsight, our opinions of this project have certainly evolved. At times, we cringe at any reference to the lyrics, or will mock our former aspirations of teenage pop punk stardom. However, I've put this project up in its entirety as a memoriam of our time together. Between the ages of 15 to 17, we spent several hours a day writing our first songs, performing local shows, and ultimately recording this album. Working in this band solidified my identity as a musician, and is the root of my passion not just for punk rock, but for performing, creativity, and artistry in general. I am forever indebted to the friends I made in the band, and in the ever vibrant and supportive Yonkers music scene.
