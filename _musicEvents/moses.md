text: Perhaps my fondest memories of Brown University take place within the Granoff Recording Studio. In the fall semester of 2014, I had the opportunity to take "Advanced Recording Studio Techniques," under Professor Jim Moses. The course was highly collaborative, and I had the pleasure of working with Peter Bowden. Our homework consisted of outfitting a guitar and drum kit with microphones, hitting record, and improvising together for several hours. We'd reconvene the next day, and pick out our favorite few minutes to mix and master. The Jim Moses EP is a small selection of our works from that semester.
roles: [drum, record, mix, master, guitar]
